# Angular2_Foundation_Skeleton
A simple skeleton that can be used to build Angular2 applications. It currently uses ES6 (via [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) and Node.js for the backend (via [Express](http://expressjs.com/)).

#### Quick How To:
- Fork or clone this project onto your local machine.
- Assuming you have npm installed run `npm install` in the newly cloned directory to install the dependecies.
- Run `gulp development` to build the angular app and fire up a local server.

A big thanks to [shuhei's](https://github.com/shuhei) repository '[babel-angular2-app](https://github.com/shuhei/babel-angular2-app)' for helping me to get started!
